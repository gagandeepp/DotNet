ADO.NET is an object-oriented set of libraries that allows you to interact with data sources.
The SqlDataAdapter holds the SQL commands and connection object for reading and writing data.

DataSet

DataSet is a disconnected orient architecture that means there is no need of active connections during work with datasets and it is a collection of DataTables and relations between tables. It is used to hold multiple tables with data. You can select data form tables, create views based on table and ask child rows over relations.

protected void BindGridview()
{
    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Data Source=abc;Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=Test");
    conn.Open();
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Select UserName, First Name,LastName,Location FROM Users", conn);
    SqlDataAdapter sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
    DataSet ds = new DataSet();
    sda.Fill(ds);
    gvUserInfo.DataSource = ds;
    gvUserInfo.DataBind();
}


DataTable 

DataTable represents a single table in the database. It has rows and columns. There is no much difference between dataset and datatable, dataset is simply the collection of datatables.

protected void BindGridview()
{
     SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("Data Source=abc;Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=Test");
     conn.Open();
     SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Select UserName, First Name,LastName,Location FROM Users", conn);
     SqlDataAdapter sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
     DataTable dt = new DataTable();
     da.Fill(dt);
     gridview1.DataSource = dt;
     gvidview1.DataBind();
}

DataAdapter

DataAdapter will acts as a Bridge between DataSet and database. This dataadapter object is used to read the data from database and bind that data to dataset. Dataadapter is a disconnected oriented architecture. Check below sample code to see how to use DataAdapter in code:

protected void BindGridview()
{
    SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("Data Source=abc;Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=Test");
    conn.Open();
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Select UserName, First Name,LastName,Location FROM Users", conn);
    SqlDataAdapter sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
    DataSet ds = new DataSet();
    da.Fill(ds);
    gvUserInfo.DataSource = ds;
    gvUserInfo.DataBind();
}
Lets you close the connection as soon it's done loading data, and may even close it for you automatically
All of the results are available in memory
You can iterate over it as many times as you need, or even look up a specific record by index
Has some built-in faculties for updating back to the database.

DataReader

DataReader is used to read the data from database and it is a read and forward only connection oriented architecture during fetch the data from database. DataReader will fetch the data very fast when compared with dataset. Generally we will use ExecuteReader object to bind data to datareader.
Protected void BindGridview()
{
using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Data Source=abc;Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=Test"))
{
con.Open();
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Select UserName, First Name,LastName,Location FROM Users", conn);
SqlDataReader sdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
gvUserInfo.DataSource = sdr;
gvUserInfo.DataBind();
conn.Close();
}
}
Holds the connection open until you are finished (don't forget to close it!).
Can typically only be iterated over once
Is not as useful for updating back to the database


DataView

A dataview is a view on a datatable, a bit like a sql view. It allows you to filter and sort the rows - often for binding to a windows form control.

Additionally, a DataView can be customized to present a subset of data from the DataTable. This capability allows 
you to have two controls bound to the same DataTable, but showing different versions of the data. For example, one 
control may be bound to a DataView showing all of the rows in the table, while a second may be configured to display
only the rows that have been deleted from the DataTable. The DataTable also has a DefaultView property which returns
the default DataView for the table.

DataView custDV = new DataView(custDS.Tables["Customers"],   
    "Country = 'USA'",   
    "ContactName",   
    DataViewRowState.CurrentRows);
